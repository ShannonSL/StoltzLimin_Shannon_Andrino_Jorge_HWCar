# StoltzLimin_Shannon_Andrino_Jorge_HWCar

Project Outline

Each team will develop a responsive mobile-first application to showcase an interactive implementation of your design. Please note that this means that you can consider how the graphics and interactivity evolve as a web app. Start with a splash page with a “hero shot” - but use a video produced in 3001 instead. See the provided example as a reference. Include some UI elements for navigation - you’ll need to move from this page to an interactive “details” page that showcases selected features. The “details” page should also have controls to navigate and view product details.
